use the code in v1

the main file you will run is a jupyter notebook called segment_images-official-training.ipynb
- to help you learn how to use the code
- when you know what you are doing, you can use the template notebook for your experiments

However, before you can jump right in, you need to install some stuff. 

Begin by downloading anaconda for python 3, on your computer. 

Once installed, look at the script: imports.sh and ensure that the path variables are correct. then run bash imports.sh

If it is successful, it should install and update several items.

You should now be ready to run things locally using the command:

jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10 --port=4940


to run things on the cluster:

you need to read about and download Jupystra
then setup your environment on the cluster, i.e. install anaconda and run the imports script on the cluster, use a compute node
next copy the mothermachine code to the cluster

put the mothermachine file into anaconda's site packages, ~/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mothermachine

This will allow the cluster workers to access them.

Finally, note that to copy file to the cluster you need to use a transfer node:

ssh uname@transfer.hms.harvard.edu

then you can use rsync to copy files.

to connect and run analysis on the server, you run Jupystra with something like:

~/anaconda3/bin/python JupyStra.py uname --wall_time=1:30:00 --cores=2 --mem=60G --count=120 --connect


where you replace uname with your username
